Problem context:
You work as a data scientist in a small team with three other data scientists
for a cargo shipping company based in the port of Turku in Finland. 90%
of the goods imported into Finland come via cargo ships at the ports across
the country. For cargo shipping, weather conditions and logistics can be
challenging at times at the ports. Rainy conditions can distort operations and
logistics at the ports, which can affect the supply chain operations. Forecasting
rainy conditions in advance gives the possibility to optimize resources such as
human resources, logistics, and transport resources for efficient supply chain
operations at ports. Business-wise, forecasting rainy conditions in advance
enables ports to reduce operational costs by up to ~20% by enabling efficient
planning and scheduling of human resources, logistics, and transport resources
for supply chain operations.

Task:
You as a data scientist are tasked with developing an ML-driven solution to
forecast weather conditions 4 hours in advance at the port of Turku in Finland.
That will enable the port to optimize its resources, thereby enabling cost-
savings of up to 20%. To get started, you are provided with a historic weather
dataset covering a timeline of 10 years from the port of Turku (the dataset can
be accessed in the next chapter). Your task is to build a continuous-learning-
driven ML solution to optimize operations at the port of Turku.

Steps:
To solve this problem, we will use Microsoft Azure, one of the most widely used cloud
services, and MLflow, an open source ML development tool, to get hands-on with using
resources. This way, we will get experience working on the cloud and with open source
software. Before starting the hands-on implementation in the next chapter, please make
sure to do the following:
1. Create a free Azure subscription from https://azure.microsoft.com/
(takes 5 minutes).
2. Create an Azure Machine Learning service application with the name MLOps_WS.
This can be done from your Azure portal by clicking Create a resource. Then
type Machine Learning into the search field and select the Machine Learning
option. Then, follow the detailed instructions in the next chapter (Chapter 3, Code
Meets Data) to create the Azure Machine Learning service resource with the name
MLOps_WS.
